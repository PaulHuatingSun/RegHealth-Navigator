RegHealth Navigator is an intelligent regulatory document analysis platform designed to facilitate efficient understanding and analysis of complex healthcare regulatory policies. The system supports large-scale XML document partitioning, semantic retrieval, question answering, and visualization.

## Project Purpose

- Enable healthcare, compliance, and policy professionals to efficiently interpret and track U.S. federal regulatory content.
- Provide structured parsing, section-based summarization, semantic search, question answering, comparison, and mind map visualization for large XML rule documents.
- Support local caching and high-performance retrieval for multi-turn interactive analysis.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite. Implements a three-column SPA interface for file selection, section operations, semantic Q&A, and visualization.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.8+). Handles XML partitioning, chunking, embedding generation, vector retrieval, and LLM orchestration.
- **Static Site Deployment:** The frontend is built and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
- **Backend Exposure:** Cloudflare Tunnel or frp is recommended to securely expose the FastAPI backend for API access by the frontend.

## Technical Workflow

1. **Document Ingestion:** Regulatory XML documents are ingested from the Federal Register or uploaded by users (≤ 200 MB). Documents are stored in a central repository.
2. **XML Partitioning:** Large XML files are automatically partitioned into logical sections (e.g., "Medicare Physician Fee Schedule").
3. **Chunking:** Each section is split into manageable text chunks for embedding and retrieval.
4. **Embedding & Indexing:** Chunks are embedded (e.g., via OpenAI API) and stored in a vector database with section and location metadata.
5. **Section-Level Operations:** All LLM-based features (Q&A, summarization, comparison) operate at the section level to optimize context and performance.
6. **API & Frontend:** The backend API and frontend support section selection and section-level operations. Users can select a section for Q&A, summary, or comparison.
7. **Caching:** Derived artifacts (summaries, embeddings, mind maps) are cached for efficient reuse.

## Recent Changes

- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated frontend build and deployment to GitHub Pages.
- Updated Pages configuration to support static frontend and decoupled backend API deployment.
- Node.js version is set to 18 (see `.nvmrc`).

## Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Python 3.8+
- npm
- Recommended: Cloudflare Tunnel or frp for backend exposure

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RegHealth-Navigator.git
   cd RegHealth-Navigator
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd front
   nvm use # Ensure Node.js 18 is active
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Deployment

### Frontend (Static Site)
- On push to the main or dev branch, GitHub Actions automatically builds the frontend and deploys the contents of `front/dist` to the `gh-pages` branch.
- In the repository Settings > Pages, set Source to "GitHub Actions".
- The deployed site is available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/RegHealth-Navigator/`.

### Backend (API Service)
- Deploy the FastAPI backend to a server or cloud platform supporting Python 3.8+.
- Use Cloudflare Tunnel or frp to securely expose the backend API endpoint to the public internet.
- Configure the frontend to use the public API endpoint for all backend requests.

## Features

- 🔄 **Real-time Regulation Updates & Parsing**: Continuously monitors and ingests newly published U.S. federal healthcare regulations (e.g., from Federal Register) in XML format and parses them into logical sections.
- 🧠 **Semantic Search & Question Answering**: Enables users to perform semantic queries and section-specific Q&A using LLMs integrated with vector retrieval.
- 📑 **Section-based Summarization**: Automatically summarizes selected regulatory sections with citations and metadata.
- 🔄 **Version Comparison**: Allows side-by-side comparison of similar sections across different regulatory versions.
- 🗺️ **Mind Map Visualization**: Generates interactive mind maps to visualize document structure and relationships between sections.
- ⚡ **Local Caching for Performance**: Caches derived artifacts like embeddings, summaries, and visualizations to support fast, repeated access.
- 🧩 **Frontend-Backend Integration**: SPA frontend interacts with FastAPI backend through a modular API interface supporting section-level operations.
